# ML-for-the-diagnosis-of-Wilson-s-Disease-via-ICP-MS
This repository contains the code code used to define and train the model presented in the paper: Cu fractionation, isotopic analysis, and data processing via machine learning: new approaches for the diagnosis and follow up of Wilsonâ€™s Disease via ICP-MS
It also includes the code used to generate the uncertainty metric.

Wilson_ML.py: includes the code used to train the models and generate the results.

Anlysis_Uncertainty.py: includes the functions to analize the uncertainty present in the outputs of the 50 NNs ensemble
